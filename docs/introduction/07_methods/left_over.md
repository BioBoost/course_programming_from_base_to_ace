Important to note is that **methods are most of the time called on objects**. This means that an action is requested from that object.

> **INFO** - **Functions and Procedures**

> Some programmers also talk about functions and procedures. Functions are blocks of named code that can be called on their own, without an object. Functions and procedures are part of functional programming languages such as C. In those languages a procedure is a function that does not return a result value. In object oriented programming this distinction is not made and they are all called methods. Of course some object oriented languages allow you to define methods that are not part of a class, in which case the name function can be considered correct.
